## About me

[//]: # (This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/. )
I am a PhD student at the [Audio Information Research Lab](https://labsites.rochester.edu/air/), University of Rochester, working with [Prof. Zhiyao Duan](https://hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/zduan/).

My research interests include 
speech and audio processing for virtual and augmented reality, 
such as audio-visual rendering and analysis, synthetic voice spoofing detection, and personalized spatial audio.

If you would like to collaborate with me or discuss anything, drop me an email.
